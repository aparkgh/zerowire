**ZeroWire** is a custom-built wireless USB HID mouse featuring USB-C charging[^1] and a 2.4GHz radio-based transceiver/receiver system[^2].

## **Components Used**
- Razer Viper V2 Pro
- 3D printed shell
- MX Anywhere 2 PCB
- Tiger Ice V2 Dot Skates
- 3.7V 1000mAh Lipo Battery + TP4056 Charger Module
- TTC 80M Switch (x2)
- Jumper Wires
- 12V Multimeter

## **Project Outline:**
> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Two mice will be created. One will be a wireless mouse using 2.4Ghz RF and USB-C and one will be a wired mouse using Micro-USB.
- Custom breakout board PCB for PAW3395 ordered (credit to [ufan's breakout board](https://github.com/ufan/paw3395_pmw3361_breakout))
- [KiCAD](https://www.kicad.org/download/windows/) used to review PCB and schematic
- Custom Razer Viper V2 / Zeromouse V35 shell .stl downloaded and reviewed in [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard) and [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio) (can be downloaded [here](https://www.printables.com/model/979182-lightweight-zeromouse-inspired-logitech-mx-mouse-m/files) or in [/files](https://github.com/aparkgh/zerowire/blob/main/files/Mouse%20Mod%20Final%20V1.stl)) NEEDS UPDATE!!!
- Zeromouse V35 Shell printed at Craftcloud

> [!NOTE]
> **Note:** Model photos need update!

## **Things that went well:**
- AliExpress offers a wide range of electronic components at relatively low prices, making it a great resource for budget-conscious projects. The caveat, however, is the longer shipping times, which can delay progress if not planned for in advance.

## **Complications:**
- needs update

[^1]: USB-C is reversible, supports higher USB versions and power delivery, offers greater durability, and enables faster data transfer. While USB-C boards are generally more expensive than Micro USB, the cost difference is negligible and justified by the enhanced feature set.
[^2]: Bluetooth pairing is slightly more power-efficient and doesn’t require a dongle, and it also operates on the 2.4GHz frequency. However, using 2.4GHz RF (proprietary wireless) offers significantly lower latency (typically reduced from 100–200 ms to around 1 ms), a longer connection range, and simpler pairing for dedicated use cases.
