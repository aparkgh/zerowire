# Custom Mouse

After completing ELEC1601 and being inspired to creating own snake game as my first physical microcontroller (arduino) project, I've decided to scale things up and build my own **wireless mouse**. I've specifically decided to utilise a transceiver and receiver system using 2.4GHz to avoid using bluetooth, and incorporated USB-C charging.

## **Components Used**
- Raspberry Pi Pico (USB-C)
- PixArt PAW3395 Sensor
- NRF24L01+ Transceiver + CH340 USB Receiver
- MT3608 2-24V to 5V DC Boost Converter
- 3.7V 1000mAh Lipo Battery + TP4056 Charger Module
- Omron D2F-01L Switch (x2)
- Jumper Wires
- 12V Multimeter

## **Setup Instructions**
- unfinished :( still waiting for parts to arrive

### 1. **Component Configuration**

> [!NOTE]
> A multimeter is required to tune the DC boost converter to 5V.
