## **Things that went well:**
- AliExpress offers a wide range of electronic components at relatively low prices, making it a great resource for budget-conscious projects. The caveat, however, is the longer shipping times, which can delay progress if not planned for in advance.

## **Complications:**
- With almost no prior knowledge of the components or MicroPython, I turned to online guides to build a foundational understanding. I deliberately avoided YouTube tutorials and refrained from copying existing projects, choosing instead to learn and problem-solve through building a unique solution from scratch. Once I had a basic grasp of the system, I created a UML diagram to map how all the components would be wired together. Additionally, I maintained an Excel price sheet to track all expenses, ensuring that anyone looking to replicate the project would have a clear understanding of the total cost involved.
- Mounting the Raspberry Pi Pico via BOOTSEL mode requires a USB cable that supports data transfer. Unbeknownst to me at the time, most of the cables I owned were charge-only, with only one capable of transferring data. This initially led to confusion during setup, as the Pico wasn’t being detected by my computer.
- Midway through the project, I found that I needed to find a custom PCB for the PAW3395 sensor, as it requires a breakout board to sit between the sensor and the lens for proper alignment and functionality. This involved sourcing a compatible PCB design and then finding a manufacturer who could print and ship it affordably, adding another layer of complexity to the build.
- Obtaining the datasheet for the sensor proved more challenging than expected. To retrieve movement data, I needed to initialize SPI communication between the sensor and the Raspberry Pi Pico. However, the technical details required for this process—such as the SPI initialization sequence and power-on procedure—were only available in the official datasheet. Since the document is confidential, I had to contact PixArt directly, sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), and as a result, I am unable to publicly share its contents, which include critical information like assembly guidelines and schematic references.
- Midway through the project, I decided it would be more practical to create two separate mice. This decision came after facing numerous complications and revisions—I went through three different mouse shells, tried multiple switch types, signed an NDA to access a confidential datasheet, and learned a lot along the way. While the project was fun, it was ultimately quite stressful, as I relied almost entirely on AI for guidance.
I invested a significant amount of time, effort, and money into parts and approaches that didn’t make it into the final product. Still, I don’t see any of that as wasted time. I learned a great deal about project management and the iterative design process, and I’m genuinely grateful for that experience. If you have the time and resources, I’d actually recommend trying this kind of project without strict guidance—you’ll face many unique challenges, but you’ll grow from them.
One small disappointment is that my fully custom mouse design ended up becoming the “throwaway” version. Nevertheless, I achieved my original goal of building a wireless mouse using USB-C and 2.4GHz RF, which is something I'm proud of. Interestingly, this approach mirrors the early modkit iterations of the Zeromouse project by Optimum, which was the original inspiration for this video. I was aware of this but intentionally avoided a modkit path because I wanted to pursue a true DIY solution.
That ambition proved a bit too difficult given my limited experience in PCB design. I struggled to identify compatible components, source the right parts, and find a PCB and shell that worked well together. While I used some of my initial components during testing—like the Raspberry Pi Pico and a custom breakout board for the PAW3395 sensor—most were ultimately not used in the final build.
In the end, I settled on two mice: one, a wireless custom-built mouse using USB-C and 2.4GHz RF; the other, a wired mouse with micro-USB. The original components were meant for the wireless build, but integrating all the necessary features—buttons, scroll wheel, etc.—was too complex. So, I pivoted. I ended up modding a Logitech MX Anywhere 2 for the wired version and a Viper V2 Pro for the wireless one. The wired version will still use the PAW3395 sensor, but I opted for TTC Gold 80M switches instead of my original choice.
Currently, the project is in a bit of a limbo. I’m in the process of moving houses, and because the scope has split into two builds, I’ve decided to simplify this repository by focusing only on the original wireless mouse. That said, given all the effort I put into the wired design, I still want to finish it—even if it turns out to be significantly less refined.

[^1]: USB-C is reversible, supports higher USB versions and power delivery, offers greater durability, and enables faster data transfer. While USB-C boards are generally more expensive than Micro USB, the cost difference is negligible and justified by the enhanced feature set.
[^2]: Bluetooth pairing is slightly more power-efficient and doesn’t require a dongle, and it also operates on the 2.4GHz frequency. However, using 2.4GHz RF (proprietary wireless) offers significantly lower latency (typically reduced from 100–200 ms to around 1 ms), a longer connection range, and simpler pairing for dedicated use cases.
